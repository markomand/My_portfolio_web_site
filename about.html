                    <p>
                        I consider myself as having good communicative skills. I love working in teams of more members
where my individual quality can contribute to the collective betterment and prosperity. I have realized
the importance of teamwork while constantly taking part in the different sports collectives, especially
by playing basketball from the early age. The importance of having good and quality relations with
people also became evident while occasionally working in catering industry. Proficient knowledge in
English language in both written and spoken communication.
